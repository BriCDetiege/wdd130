    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <img alt="picofme" src="images/picofme.jpg">
    <h2>I am Brianna and I finally succeeded at this part of coding and making a webpage.</h2>
    <h2>I go by Bri because everyone always says Brianna wrong.</h2>
    <p>I have lived in 7 states. This includes Washington State, where I was born and adopted. From Washington, we moved to Colorado, where my little brother was born. After Colorado was New Mexico, then Texas. After Texas, we moved to Ohio, and then moved from there to Florida during the pandemic, where we lived for a year and a half before moving to Utah. I am a high-school senior. I graduate in December and am taking Dual Enrollment classes with BYUI. I am taking 5 classes with BYUI and am super excited to learn. I love to read, listen to music, hang out with friends, and hike/workout. My favorite color is pink, my favorite animal is a wolf, and my favorite food is pizza. I struggled a lot making this because when I followed along with the video, I was always missing one line of code, but I finally decided to just type it in, and here we are. This is literally amazing because we can say basically whatever, although the link doesn't work when you send it (I tried).</p>
    <p>I am not married yet (only 17 after all), but I hope to one day find someone who loves me with all his heart, no matter the mistakes I have made, but loves me because of them. I plan on getting a degree in Social work because I want to help children in adoption agencies. I have been a member of the church since I was 8, because that is when I got baptized, but I grew up in the church. I have a lot of quotes that I love from prophets and apostles of the church. I think my favorite though, is this, "Remember who you are, and what God expects you to become." (Thomas S. Monson). </p>
    <p>So excited to meet you all and code with you!</p>
    <p>This is probably really odd, but I want to send a shout out to the following people: Jolie, Jade, Taylor, Alli, Aspen, and Laney (Oh, and Mr. K). YOU GUYS HAVE MADE MY LIFE SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I MOVED HERE. YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!! THANK YOU!!!</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Bri Detiege</p>
